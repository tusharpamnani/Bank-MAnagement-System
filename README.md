# Bank Management System

The Bank Management System is a C++ application that allows users to manage customers, create bank accounts, perform deposits and withdrawals, and display account details.

## Features

The Bank Management System provides the following functionalities:

1. **Add Customer:** Add a new customer to the bank's customer database. The user will be prompted to enter the customer's details such as name, address, contact information, and any other relevant information. The new customer record will be added to the database.

2. **Create Account:** Create a new bank account for a customer. The user needs to provide the customer's information, such as their customer ID or name, and specify the type of account to be created (e.g., savings account, checking account). The system will generate a unique account number and associate it with the customer.

3. **Deposit:** Deposit money into a specific bank account. The user needs to provide the account number and specify the amount to be deposited. The system will update the account balance accordingly.

4. **Withdraw:** Withdraw money from a specific bank account. The user needs to provide the account number and specify the amount to be withdrawn. The system will validate if the account has sufficient balance and update the account balance accordingly.

5. **Display Accounts:** Display details of all bank accounts in the system. It provides an overview of each account, including the account number, customer details, account type, and current balance.

6. **Exit:** Terminate the bank management session. Choosing this option will exit the program.
